### All:
- It will be better to make 1 table, and all parts should be inside this one table^ not a separate 3 tables for each parts

### Header:
- Links in menu on the right should not be bold

### Center:
- "Ваша завка принята. Мы свяжемся с вами в ближайшее время для подтверждения заказа №123415" - here line-height should be bigger
- "дата: 01.04.2016" to high^ it should be on the base line with "Заказ №123415"
- Main grey table should have borders in the left and right


### Footer:
- Phones should be in the center (I know they are - but it looks like they don't fix it by defining width to cells or something else)
- Footer should also have borders on the left right and bottom
